🌍 BinBeacon – Collect • Connect • Correct

Build me a full smart waste management prototype app with these specifications.
No backend, no database, no payments yet — just front-end with mock data.
The app should be smooth, multilingual (English, Hindi, Tamil), with voice greetings using Web Speech API, and have both dark mode and light mode with custom background images.
Use glassmorphism (transparent blurry UI cards) for forms and dashboards.
All maps should be centered on Chennai.
